# About Me
I’m a seasoned Big Data Engineer with a decade of experience in data driven design, specializing in designing and optimizing high-performance data pipelines. My work spans database technologies, distributed systems, and cloud architecture, delivering B2B SaaS solutions used by industry giants like Salesforce, Comcast, Netflix and Amazon.

My passion lies in distributed systems—an area I explore deeply through continuous learning. I actively pursue advanced knowledge through online courses, including MIT's Distributed Systems, staying at the forefront of technological advancements.

Beyond my professional endeavors, I’m a recognized contributor in the Apache Pulsar community and enjoy sharing my expertise. In my spare time, you’ll find me on the tennis court, mountain biking, or socializing with friends.

# Main Projects
I have highlighted only a few of the projects I've encountered in my career, but I believe these are particularly significant in showcasing my experience as a Data Engineer:
## Evinced: Digital accessibility software
I am the architect and lead data engineer that designed the following projects:
- [Platform Data Pipeline](./evinced/platform_pipeline.md): A data pipeline for a scraping system that collects accessibility data for the purpose to check for accessibility compliance. The pipeline is designed to handle huge bursts of traffic and scale up and down according to traffic. The pipeline does complex data transformation to accomplish aggregated data that can be query via graphQL. The pipeline keeps up with a few million messages per minute and can scale up to meet much more for future traffic. The pipeline includes data deduplication, complex grouping of data to name a few. All of this functionality was implemented with low cloud cost.
- Designed the new pipeline via Airflow for the company's research team to use for machine learning.
- Researched and designed the pipeline for generative AI needs.

## Cynet Security: All-in-One Cybersecurity Platform 
I was the Team Lead and Principal Data Engineer where I led the design for the follwing projects:
- A XDR (detection and response) data pipeline. The pipeline was created from scratch. It includes transforming data so that it can be queried very fast. The pipeline includes a sophisticated event system that raises alerts based and a highly generic configuration of sequence of events. The pipeline stores data in various databases in order to fulfill the different query types required from the product and research team. The research includes transforming data for machine learning needs.

## Pyramid Analytics: BI Product listed in the Gardner Magic Quadrant
I was team lead and Pricible Software Engineer of the Query Logic team. I led the design of the following projects:
- Designed a proprietary query language that rivals platforms like PowerBI and Tableau. The system starts from a visual representation and then translates into a proprietary query language. This language then translates to various SQL dialects that include most databases out there. The language includes a multi dimensional ability (similar to MDX) that answers hard to solve BI queries.
- On top of this I created a NLP layer that translates natural language into our query language.
